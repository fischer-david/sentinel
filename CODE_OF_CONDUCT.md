Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment

Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior. If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it by opening an issue titled "Code of Conduct Violation" or by contacting the maintainers privately.

Contact

If you'd like the maintainers to contact you, you can add a maintainer email here. For now, please open an issue on this repository and mark it with `code-of-conduct`.
